<font face="comic sans ms" font size="5" font color="black">I have started my education from the age of 4 years. I went to school at Tadika Kemas from the age of 4 to 6 years old. Then, I continued my studies at Patani Para Primary School for 6 years from grade 1 to grade 6. I have got 4A and 1B on UPSR results. Next, at the secondary level, I went to school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bandar Sungai Petani from form 1 to form 5. In level 3 I got 3A, 4B and 1C on PT3 results and on SPM results I got 3A results as well. Now, I have continued my studies at the Diploma level at UITM Kedah. I have been offered an information management course for 2 years and a half of 5 semesters. My hope this time around is that I can graduate with excellent results so that I can be proud of both my parents.
