<font face="verdana bold" font size="6" font color="black"> After finishing SPM, I worked in a factory called Huan Shin in Sungai Petani for 5 months. Then I worked as a kitchen helper in a factory canteen. After I continued my studies at UITM Merbok, I used to work at the Sharp factory in Sungai Petani during the semester break. Finally, my latest experience is that I work part time as a waitress at a restaurant near my house. I would rather spend time working than spend time sitting at home. For me making money with my own efforts is more valuable.
